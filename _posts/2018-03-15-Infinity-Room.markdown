Today I had the chance to visit The Broad museum in Los Angeles, California. My main reason was to visit the famous Infinity Room by artist Yayoi Kusama. It's basically a bunch of lights and mirrors and it looks like you're in a field of stars. It's truly mesmerizing. My main motivation to go was because I saw a similar design in a music video by artists Kendrick Lamar and SZA. In the *All The Stars* music video SZA stands in what looks like a field of stars on two occassions. I believe these scenes were no doubt inpsired by the Infinity Room, and I knew that I had to visit it to invoke these two specific scenes.
