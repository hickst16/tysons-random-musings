I was watching a special director's cut of *Alien* over break and I was paying attention to the design of the spaceship and how it's contributed to sci-fi/horror films. Before *Alien* there was *2001: A Space Odyssey*, but unlike *Alien*, *2001* used mostly white light and bright colors. *Alien* uses dark colors to magnify the claustrophobia and tension that the film's environment operates in. Many sci-fi/horror/thriller films about deep space (like *The Cloverfield Paradox*) employ these dark corridors to invoke space-induced peril, much like *Alien* did.
