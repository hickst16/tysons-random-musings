It's currently 2:39 AM on March 22, 2018 and Washington D.C. just got through it's first major snowfall of 2018. We got quite a bit of snow, obviously enough to have school close. All this white got me thinking about how complex and beautiful the design of a single snowflake is. It's pretty crazy how nature could come up with something so intricate. The fact that every snowflake is different makes things even more amazing. Below is a snowflake under a microscope.
