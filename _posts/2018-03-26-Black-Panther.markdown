So if you haven't heard about the phenomenon that is *Black Panther*, I don't know what rock you are living under. The movie has grossed over $1 billion at the worldwide box office and has shattered myths about "what" an internationally successful movie looks like. Anyway, as a huge fan of the character, I noticed that this suit looked vastly different in design compared to the one we saw in *Captain America: Civil War*. I personally prefer the design seen in *Civil War* (the top picture) over the one seen in *Black Panther*. Not quite sure why though.
