So its no secret that the Snapchat update is awful. After many people complaining about it, they've decided not to revert back to the old format. Snapchat seems to be killing itself between this awful update and all the celebrities denouncing it. We'll have to see where they end up in the future. I think we can all agree that this is an awful design.
