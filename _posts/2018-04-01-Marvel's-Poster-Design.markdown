Another Marvel-related post for you (in case you couldn't already tell my fascination with the Marvel Cinematic Universe). Anyway, this post focuses on the homogenized layout that most recent MCU movies use. They mostly consist of the main protagonist taking up the most space in the forefront, the main villian behind him in the background, and supporting characters to the side. A lof of peolpe have caught on esepecially since the films *Thor: Ragnarok*, *Black Panther*, and *Avengers: Infinity War* all seem to have the same posters. I think Marvel Studios recycles this design so much because it works particularly well and it follows the directions we instinctually look. It just makes sense to have the protagonist in the front, villian in the back, and supporting characters to the side.
