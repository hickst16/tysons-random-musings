In my Buddhist Arts of Asia class we learned about the Buddhist Mandala. They're meant to provoke a sense of spirituality from their viewer. I thought their design was really interesting in the sense that everything is symmetrical. With the exceptions of a few aspects, almost everything you see on one side can be seen mirrored on the other side. A very intriguing design, especially considering this design was crafted hundreds of years ago.
