I remember when *Tron: Legacy* came out. It was a film I was really excited for. While it was a mediocre film, there is aboslutely no doubting how stunning the design and aesthetic of the film is. In a world that's ruled and composed by light and darkness, all things have neon light accents to them. The clothes, the landscapes, the buildings all have those neon lights. This movie was a visual masterpiece to look at and is still halied for it's visual effects to this day. The visual aspect of this movie was it's only saving grace actually.
