On that simliar vein, let's talk about the best flag there is. The California flag is the best flag and that's not because I'm from there. I really like how minimalist this flag is. Most of it is blank space. With the exception of the bear, red, and text, this flag is mostly white. This flag also is unique in the fact that it has an animal and text, somethings that are rarely seen on state flags. This flag is also just iconic, you see it everywhere.
