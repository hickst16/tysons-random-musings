We also talked about the Maryland flag in my Visual Literacy class. We talked about how the design of the flag is extremely polarizing. Some people love it (mostly the people from Maryland) while others hate it. I personally cannot stand this flag. The colors and patterns clash far too much. Just by looking at this flag it sounds dissonant. It looks like someone mixed a checkerboard with a family crest. It's awful.
