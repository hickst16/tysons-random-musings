At the time of it's peak, Myspace was rivaling with Facebook. While I never had a Myspace I was familiar with th website because my sister had one. I remember it's layout being painfully simplistic and now that I think about it, something with such a basic layout could never be as popular was it once was. I think the time and the design for Myspace was perfect. There's no way that MySpace could be that popular today. I guess they just had the right timing.
