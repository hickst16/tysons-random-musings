I remember when my sister first described the design of Walt Disney Concert Hall to me. I was quite young and she described the arcitecture as a "rose". She said the way the building was constructed made it look like a rose. I think it's a pretty accurate way to describe it honestly. This was way before I got into high school, which is ironic because I'd go on to walk across the Disney Concert Hall stage at my high school graduation.
