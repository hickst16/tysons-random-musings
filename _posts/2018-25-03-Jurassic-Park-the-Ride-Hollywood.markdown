Anyone who knows me knows that *Jurassic Park* is my absolute favorite film of all time. Similarly, anyone who knows me really well knows there was a period in my life where I was obsessed with Universal Studios Hollywood. I'm sure you could imagine how excited I was when I got the opportunity to work as a ride operator on the Jurassic Park ride at Universal Studios Hollywood last summer. Much to my dismay, the experience was miserable. However, I got to learn some cool things about the ride's design and the possible future of the ride. The ride is special because of its use of water resistant animatronics, which are very hard to replicate. That being said, the company that produced the animatronics went bankrupt and the ride is now about 20 years old. The animatronics are now slow moving and twitchy, needing to be direly replaced. However, they told us during training that there was no company to replace them, so they would continue operating this ride until the wheels literally fell off. Anyway, I quit after the summer but I still have some friends who work there. I was shocked when they told me that soon the ride would close for a complete *Jurassic World* update featuring a new track design, new waterproof animatronics, and a new climax. I guess the company lied to us to prevent us from getting any ideas, because I'm sure this update was in its developing stages when we were in our training. I'm eager to see the new update of the ride.
