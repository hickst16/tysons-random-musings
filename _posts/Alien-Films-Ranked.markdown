# *Alien* Films Ranked

The other day I was watching a special director's cut of the film *Alien* on my DVR. The filmed has aired on HBO on March 10th, and I had decided to record it for future viewing. While I was watching it I was texting my friend who also enjoys the *Alien* films. I asked him to rank the films from favorite to least favorite.

My friend's ranked list of *Alien* films:
1. *Alien*
2.* Alien Resurrection*
3. *Aliens*
4. *Alien Covenant*
5. *Alien 3*
6. *Prometheus*

I made fun of him because he prefers *Alien Resurrection* (probably the worst entry) over *Aliens* (the entry that many people regard to be better than the original).
After, he asked me what my list was, so I gave it to him.

My ranked list og *Alien* films:
*1. *Alien*
*2. Aliens*
*3. Ailen Covenant*
*4. Promerheus*
*5. Alien Resurredrion*
*6. Alien 3*
