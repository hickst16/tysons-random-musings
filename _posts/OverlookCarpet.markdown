I was on the plane yesterday and I don't remember what it was I was watching, but I saw this famous pattern. Obviously this pattern is most famously known from the hotel carpet in *The Shining*, but it has since then been appropriated by many. Anyway, I think the design is really interesting because it looks like all the lines and geometric figures run into each other and create one.
