# Things I Did Over Spring Break

While my break wasn't filled with day drinking in Canc√∫n, Mexico or partying in the wild nightclubs of Miama, Florida, I did have a chance to go to one of my favorite places in the world: California (aka home). I kicked off my spring break by flying to San Francisco where I stayed with a friend for two nights. He showed me some interesting hidden gems of the city. From there, I flew to Los Angeles, where I got to catch up on rest and relaxation with family. It was a pretty chill break for me, one of my favorite types of breaks, especially since college seems to turn me into a bit of an insomniac. Anyway, here are some interesthing things I did over break. This list is in no particular order.

* I went to The Broad museum in Los Angeles, where I go to see the famous Infinity Room
* I went to a spot in San Fran called Lands End, where the ruins of an outdoor bathhouse stands, being weathered away by the near by ocean waves
* I trekked from Reagan International Airport to Dulles because my flight at DCA got cancelled
* I slept, slept, slept (which is something I desprerately needed as I do not sleep well when I'm on the East Coast)
* I saw *A Wrinkle in Time* (which unfortunately was a major disappointment. My biggest problems with it were the pacing, the tone, and the development of the characters)
* I bought my tickets to see *Avengers: Infinity War*, which I'm extremely excited about. A big fan of superhero films and Marvel films in particular
* I bought my tickets to Durham, North Carolina. I will be visiting from March 26 - March 28 because I have to interview my grandma for one of my classes

Honestly, that's pretty much it. I really didn't do too too much this break, which was done by choice since I decided to go home. If I had gone somewhere else for a more active vacation then I would have done more, but I intentionally chose to go home to enjoy my time in California and to relax.
